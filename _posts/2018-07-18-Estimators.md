We need not only to match train data , but also can generalize to test data , so we need to a way to estimate the parameter of the real distribution of data ( named as Estimator ), also , there need a way to evaluate the Estimator accordingly .We always  make use of Bias and Variance to evaluate the quality of Estimator .  
The  important and used most often is Point Estimatiors .  

From Wiki :  
> Point estimation invlves the use of samplle data to calculate a single value (Known as point estimate or statistic) which is best guess of an unknown population parameter ( for example , the population mean) . 

Additionally , Point estimation can be contrasted with interval estimation ; such interval estimates are typically either confidece intervals in the case of frequentist inferene ,or credible intervals in the case of Bayesian inference.   
### Estimators
- Point estimation
  - Maximum likelihood estimator MLE
  - Minimum mean syared error MSE
  - Method of moments( çŸ© ) and generalized method of moments 
  - ...
- Interval estimationa


### the aim of point estimation
Through sample data to predict a value of population parameter .  
### formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\theta} = g(X)\quad X = x^1,x^2,x^3,\cdots,x^n 
\end{align*}
$$

where $X$ is the sample data and $n$ is the number of elements of sample data .
