# The Note of Maximum Likelihood Estimation  
## aim :  
- Selecting right distribution('s type) of all data (given special distribution type);
- Make the right selection of parameters.  
At the first step , distribution type is selected by person using theory and priori knowledge of samples,but sometimes it would go wrong due to imature theory and wrong priori-knowledge.
## way :  
After the work of selecting model distribution type done,next step is to learn concrete number of parameter of model distribution from sample.Maximux Likelihood Estimation is a way to do that.  
## Theory Basis:
Given sample data ,
The Derivation is wrote below.
$$\Theta_{ML} = argmax_{\Theta}\sum_{i=1}^{m}$$
